Functions specific to PLMObject : **PART**
========================================================


BOM-CHILD
========================================================
Displays BOM of the current part i.e. Parts which are under or which are in.

You can filter *1 level* (only sons) or *all levels* (grandsons, great-gransons, ...) or *last level* . You can specify a date in order to get the BOM at that time. You can also specify a state.

If you have necessary rights, you can **Add** a new Part/children specifying its type, reference, revision, its quantity (1, 2, 0.5 kg, 2.5 m, ...) and its ordering number (which define where the children is shown in the BOM).

If you have necessary rights, you can **Edit** the first level and modify quantity, ordering number or remove the Part out of the BOM.

If a document with a STEP file is linked to the current part and the part has no children, you can be asked if you want to build the BOM analysing the STEP file.


PARENTS

Displays Parts which are upon the current part.

You can filter *1 level* (only parents) or *all levels* (grandparents, great-grandparents, ...) or *last level*. You can also specify a date in order to see the assemblies where we could find the current part at that time.
