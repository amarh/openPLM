Public pages
----------------

It is now possible to publish a part or a document. A published item is accessible to
anonymous users.


Restricted account and sponsoring
--------------------------------------

A new kind of account is available: restricted account.

A restricted account can not create any contents and can only access to selective 
parts and documents.

This new account make it possible to share some contents to someone and be sure he
would not be able to modify it or see other confidential data.

To create a restricted account, you only have to sponsor a new user and
select the "restricted account" option.

Screenshot :

.. image:: whatsnew/1.1/Capture_openPLM_sponsor.png


As you can see on the screenshot above, it is now possible to sponsor a
new user who can access mostly all contents but can not modify them.

You can also select a language , the "new account" mail sent should be translated 
according to the chosen language.


Timeline
---------

The timeline is like a global history which contains :

 * all history events related to official objects
 * all history events related to objects owned by groups you are in
 

RSS feeds
----------

You can now subscribe to rss feeds for :

 * PLM objects
 * User
 * Group
 * the timeline

You can subscribre to these feeds from :

 * "History" pages
 * "Timeline" page

This feeds are updated when there is a change on the related object(s), user or group.
