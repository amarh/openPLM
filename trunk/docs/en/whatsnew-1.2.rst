What's new for users
=====================

Navigate
--------

New style
++++++++++

Nodes have been redesigned. You can now see more information about
a part or a document. It should also be easier to determinate if
a node represents a part or a document.

Small User Experience improvements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

    * Zoom factor stays when switching from one object to another.

    * You can drag graph by clicking wherever you want in the graph.

    * You can navigate at a previous date


Upload and create
------------------

You can now upload a file (or more) and create a new document
in a few clicks.


.. raw:: html

    <div>
        <br/>
        <video width="700" height="375" controls="controls">
          <source src="_downloads/upload.webm" type="video/webm" />
          Upload of a file
        </video>
    </div>

:download:`Download the video </whatsnew/1.2/upload.webm>`


Lifecycle
---------

It is now possible to asked several signers to promote or demote
a part or document.
The owner can be one of the first signers and he can easily warn other
users when he think its work is ready.

BOM
----

Comparison
++++++++++++

You can compare a BOM at two different dates.


Attached documents
+++++++++++++++++++

You can visualize a complete multi-level BOM including all attached documents:

.. figure:: /whatsnew/1.2/bom_1.png


Alternate links
+++++++++++++++++

It is possible to create a set of alternate parts.
Each usage of a part can be replaced by one of its alternate.
It is possible to include alternate parts in all BOM.

OpenPLM prevents incoherent situations (like a part parent
of one of its alternate) when BOM are built.

Files
-------

You can access to all uploaded versions of one file:

Change management
------------------

If your administrator enables them, you will be able to create
ECR (Engineering Change Requests) to request a change bound to 
several parts and documents.

Badges
------

If your administrator enables them, you will win badges by using OpenPLM â˜º.


Miscellaneous enhancements
----------------------------

    * When creating a part or a document, the group is set to the
      last selected group

    * It is possible to choose the group of a new revision

    * For each part and document, similar contents are displayed on
      the attributes page
