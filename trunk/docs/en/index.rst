PLM?
----

In a nutshell, it's a software that helps people who work on product development
i.e. Doctors, Engineers, Techniciansâ€¦ managing their technical data
like CAD files, ECAD files, source codes but also Ms Office/OpenOffice/LibreOffice/GoogleDoc files.

It's a common vault where all data are stored in a single copy.
It makes them easy to find and accessible from remote locations.

It's a system which also describes the product structures (or BOM) and their changes over time.

That way, it ensures full traceability of the product and
associated data from first marketing sketches to production and maintenance stages.
